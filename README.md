# Taskboard Application

Welcome to the Taskboard Project‚Äî which stands as the backend for the
[client side project](https://github.com/pushpalroy/JetTaskBoardKMP) written with KMP.
This is a simple P0 clone that emulates a kanban board with boards, buckets and cards.

### üìÅ DB Schema Design

### ü§î Why Server Sent Events?

Server-Sent Events (SSE) enables a unidirectional, real-time communication channel between a server and a client. With
SSE, the server can initiate a continuous stream of updates or events to the client over a single HTTP connection.
SSE was considered over websockets since it provides an asynchronous unidirectional server push. Some links that
informed me about this was from
a [LinkedIn blog](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2016/10/instant-messaging-at-linkedin--scaling-to-hundreds-of-thousands-)
and [stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5195452/websockets-vs-server-sent-events-eventsource).
Also,
a performance comparison on [sse and websocket](https://www.timeplus.com/post/websocket-vs-sse).

### üëÄ Why Optimistic Lock?

Locks are necessary to prevent concurrent row changes in the database. This mechanism is used to prevent concurrent card
updates in this project. Some videos on the topic are [Link 1](https://youtu.be/I8IlO0hCSgY)
and [Link 2](https://youtu.be/H_zJ81I_D5E).

### üèóÔ∏è How to set up the project.

1. Create a Database with the name "kanbanDB".
2. Run flyway gradle migrate task and make sure that the tables are created in the DB.
3. Run generate jOOQ task to find the generated classes in build/kotlin folder.
